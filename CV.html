        <h1>PERSONAL STATEMENT:</h1>
        <hr>
        I am currently a 1st year Computer Science student studying at Queen Mary University in
        London. I am currently seeking part-time employment in retail to expand my customer
        service and communication and commercial awareness skills. I work well both within a
        team and as an independent individual as I take great pride in overcoming challenges and
        tasks set by my managers. Through my studies I’ve learnt to work well under pressure and
        during my time shadowing and supporting the Daily Paper store events I’ve learned to work
        on my attention to detail and time management.
        <hr>
        <h3>SKILLS</h3>
        Customer service + sales skills:
        - I developed my sales skills through assisting in the day to day running of a small
        Somali clothing boutique for a family friend. I exercise my persuasive skills by paying
        close attention to customers' needs and wants.
        Good communication skills:
        - I am consistently working on my communication skills through different areas of my
        life. From university environments and playing semi pro football within a team.
        - I also support in coaching my brother’s football team where I liaise with game days.
        Team-work:
        - I take great pride in my team working ability. Having been part of a semi pro football
        team I understand the value of working together. I also put this in practice during my
        university course and day to day support of coaching U16 football team.
        - I also have took part in support the back end of a few Daily Paper store activations by
        working alongside the event producer and store team on executing small tasks.
        Problem Solving + attention to detail:
        - Developing my problem solving skills has been a self-fulfilling experience as I enjoy
        paying close attention to detail to ensure I complete a task or solve a problem. I have
        great initiatives and can think outside of the box when necessary.
